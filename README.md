# Java-ChessBot (Under Development)
A simple Chessbot that is currently under development in java, it will use a basic minimax search to find and make the best move. Currently it is just a board with pieces on it and those pieces can be moved with the mouse or by using Board.makeMove() method. Legal moves have not yet been implemented. Below is a picture of the programme this far:
